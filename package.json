  "description": "The DataGrid widget includes a comprehensive set of appearance and behavior customization options for individual grid columns. In this example, column selection, reordering, resizing and fixed columns are enabled and the following custom settings have been applied: custom alignment has been set for the Position column; a calculated value is displayed for the Employee column. The Employee column is also anchored to the grid’s left edge, so it is always displayed in the grid regardless of horizontal scrolling. You can disable the fixed column or fix a different column within the grid container using the column header’s context menu.\n\n        ",
